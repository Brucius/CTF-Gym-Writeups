# CTF-Writeups

A collection of CTF-Writeups. I have also written some quick tools to solve general CTF problems and can be found at https://github.com/Brucius/picoCTF-tools.

**QUICK DISCLAIMER** : These are only writeups to document my thought process while solving a challenge. Only the how-tos are written and all of the solutions are not given in these writeups to prevent spoiling the fun.
