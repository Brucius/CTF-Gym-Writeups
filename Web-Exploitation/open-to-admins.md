## Question

This secure website allows users to access the flag only if they are admin and if the time is exactly 1400. [link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/64751/) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:64751

## Hint

Can cookies help you to get the flag?

## Solution

<!-- TODO picoCTF{0p3n_t0_adm1n5_132f8585} -->
This challenge can be solved by using chrome's developer console to create 2 additional values in the cookie to impersonate as an admin and set the time as 1400.
