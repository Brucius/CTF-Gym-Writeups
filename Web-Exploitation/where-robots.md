## Question

Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/

## Hint

What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## Solution

This particular flag took a while but once understood it was very simple. I had to google about websites where the creator would be able to hide the web pages using robots.txt from the search engine indexing.

Simply, you can navigate to the root of the web page. Robots.txt file are always located in the root. 

For example
```www.google.com/robots.txt```

This page shows all the pages google doesn't want you to see. Do the same for the challenge page and you'll see the disallow html page that has the flag.

## Improvement

None
