## Question

Can you break into this super secure portal? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/17682/ or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:17682

## Hint

Never trust the client

## Solution

The main objective of this challenge is to illustrate never to use any password checking on the client side (browsers).

The web portal given prompts the user for a valid credential for verification to proceed to next step. After snooping around the web page, a javascript function called ```verify()``` is discovered where the flag is broken in to 8 different parts for checking valid credential.

The catch here is, the if statements are not in order for checking different parts of the flag. Simply need to understand what the code is doing and follow the number sequence from the code to get the flag in correct order.

Here is a useful resource to find out what javascript ```substring()``` function does by w3schools. https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_substring.asp

None
