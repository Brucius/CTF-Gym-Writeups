## Question

What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10)?

## Hint

Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was '22', you would submit 'picoCTF{22}' as the flag.

## Solution

Simply converting hexadecimal 0x3D (base16) to decimal (base 10). [Ascii table](https://www.systutorials.com/f/2013/ascii.txt) can be used to solve this flag. 

## Improvement

A quick python script can be written to quickly convert bases instead of referring to ascii table.
