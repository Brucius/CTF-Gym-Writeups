## Question

Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?

## Hint

Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if your answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.

## Solution

Simply converting number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2). [Ascii table](https://www.systutorials.com/f/2013/ascii.txt) can be used to solve this flag. 

## Improvement

A quick python script can be written to quickly convert bases instead of referring to ascii table.
