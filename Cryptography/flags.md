## Question

What do the [flags](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/fbeb5f9040d62b18878d199cdda2d253/flag.png) mean?

## Hint

The flag is in the format PICOCTF{}

## Solution
A png file of flags are arranged in the flag format.
![image](./flagsmd/flag.png)

From the image, it can be deduced that each flag would have a letter tied to it. ```picoctf{.....}```

A simple google search for "flag signals" returned wikipage for the letter representing each flag and the message can be decoded.
